# 🎬 Movie Recap Script Helper

I run a **movie recap channel** and often take scripts from online.  
Previously, I had to **manually split long scripts** before giving them to ChatGPT for refinement — a tedious process.  

So, I built a tool that:

- ✂️ Splits long scripts automatically  
- ✨ Refines them with AI  
- 🔗 Merges everything back in one click  
- 🖥️ Comes with a clean UI  
- 🧠 Supports remember prompt functionality  
- 📋 Copy-to-clipboard support for quick use  

This makes my workflow **faster, easier, and less repetitive**. 🚀
